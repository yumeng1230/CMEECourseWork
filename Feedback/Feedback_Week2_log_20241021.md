# Feedback for Yumeng on Project Structure, Workflow, and Python Code

## Project Structure and Workflow

### General Structure
- **Repository Layout**: The project structure is organized well, with directories such as `code`, `sandbox`, `results`, and `data`. However, some redundant files, like `test.py` and `cfexercisr2.py`, were found. These files should either be organized appropriately into a `tests` folder or removed.
- **README Files**:
  - The `README.md` file in the root folder contains minimal information. It should include more detailed documentation, such as project goals, dependencies, installation steps, and how to execute scripts.
  - The `README.md` file in `week2` provides basic information about scripts, but detailed usage instructions (input/output, examples) would improve clarity and usability.

### Workflow
- **Results Directory**: The `results` directory is empty as expected, which is good practice. Ensure output files are dynamically generated during script execution and kept out of version control.
- **Extra Files**: There are a few extra files like `test.py` that seem redundant or misorganized. Ensure unnecessary files are removed or placed in appropriate folders (e.g., `tests` or `sandbox`).

## Python Code Feedback

### General Code Quality
- **PEP 8 Compliance**: While the code generally follows Python's style guide, some functions lack proper docstrings, and there are a few minor issues with spacing and indentation. Ensuring strict adherence to PEP 8 will improve readability.
- **Docstrings**: Many scripts and functions are missing docstrings, which should describe the purpose, parameters, and return values. Adding detailed docstrings will enhance code maintainability and understanding.
- **Error Handling**: Some scripts (e.g., `basic_csv.py`) assume the existence of input files without checking. Adding file existence checks and `try-except` blocks would make the scripts more robust.

### Detailed Code Review

#### `align_seqs.py`
- **Modularization**: The sequence alignment code is well-written but could benefit from further modularization by splitting the logic into smaller, reusable functions.
- **Error Handling**: The script assumes that input files are present without checking. Adding proper error handling will improve the script's reliability.
- **Docstrings**: The script lacks function-level docstrings, which should be added for better clarity.

#### `cfexercise1.py`
- **Redundancy**: The script contains multiple functions for factorial calculations (`foo_4`, `foo_5`, `foo_6`). Consider consolidating these into a single function with different implementation approaches to avoid redundancy.
- **Docstrings**: While some functions have basic docstrings, they could be expanded to describe the inputs and outputs in greater detail.

#### `oaks_debugme.py`
- **Doctests**: This script includes useful doctests for the `is_an_oak` function. However, additional test cases for edge conditions should be included to ensure the function handles more varied inputs.
- **Error Handling**: As with other scripts, ensure that input file existence is checked before attempting to read it.

#### `lc1.py` and `lc2.py`
- **List Comprehensions**: These scripts effectively demonstrate the use of list comprehensions but lack sufficient comments and docstrings. Adding more descriptive comments and explanations would make the code easier to follow.
- **Docstrings**: Both scripts lack high-level docstrings describing the script's purpose. These should be added.

#### `dictionary.py`
- **Dictionary Operations**: The script functions as intended, creating a dictionary from the provided species data. However, a high-level docstring is missing. Adding this would clarify the purpose of the script.

#### `tuple.py`
- **Functionality**: This script successfully prints bird data but lacks a script-level docstring. Adding this will make the script easier to understand.

### Final Remarks
The project demonstrates a solid understanding of Python concepts, including list comprehensions, control flow, and file handling. However, the following improvements are recommended:
1. Add detailed docstrings to all scripts and functions to improve readability and understanding.
2. Implement error handling for file operations to make the scripts more robust.
3. Remove or organize extra files to keep the repository clean and well-structured.
