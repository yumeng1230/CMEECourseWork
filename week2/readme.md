**Description**

This project includes a series of Python scripts demonstrating fundamental programming concepts

**Important Note**
To ensure proper execution of the scripts, all files must be located in the directory:
Documents/CMEECourseWork/week2/code.

**Scripts**

#align_seqs.py

This script reads two DNA sequences from a file, compares them, and finds the best alignment between the sequences. The results are saved in a text file in results folder.

#cfexercise1

This script contains several utility functions that demonstrate basic mathematical operations such as finding square roots, determining the larger value, sorting values, and calculating factorials. It includes both iterative and recursive methods to calculate factorials. The script also contains a main function that runs and displays the results of these operations.

#dictionary.py

This script organizes a list of animal species and their taxonomic orders into a dictionary (taxa_dic). The dictionary maps each order to a set of species belonging to that order. The script demonstrates two methods: using a standard loop and using a list comprehension.

#lc1.py

This script extracts three separate lists from a tuple of bird data, where each bird entry contains the Latin name, common name, and mean body mass. It demonstrates two approaches: using list comprehensions and using conventional loops.

#lc2.py

This script processes UK rainfall data for 1910, using both list comprehensions and conventional loops to filter and extract specific months based on rainfall amounts.

#tuple.py

This script iterates over a tuple of bird species, where each entry contains the Latin name, common name, and body mass of the bird. It prints each bird's details on a separate line in a formatted manner.

oaks_debugme.py

This script processes a CSV file containing taxonomic data and identifies entries where the genus is close to "Quercus" (using fuzzy matching). It writes the matching entries (oak species) to a new CSV file.
